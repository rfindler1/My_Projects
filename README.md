## My_Projects
-----------------
#### This repo contains small coded projects I have made during the completion of my Udemy Python course and whilst carrying out work for ARGANS.



### **NASA_Earthdata_AJD_Converter**
Is a jupyter notebook code that allows for the conversion of dates (provided my NASA Earthdata) in an Astronomers Julian Day format into Gregorian Date and Time format. 


### **noughts_and_crosses**
Originally created in jupyter notebook, this python code is my very first 'comprehensive' code and I hope that as my skills improve, I will be able to come back and make new iterations of the game, which are a bit more succinct.
